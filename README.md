# GameFinder

## Description.
 
For our Group project we decided to make a easy to use gamefinder project that allows you to search for games within the same criteria of your choice. We also implemented LocalStorage to save users input for the next time they visit our site.


## How to Use.

To use our project no downloads are required ,simply click on the search bar in the top right to be redirected to our other page where you will encounter search criteria to narrow down list of suggested games tailored to your personal selected preferrences.


## Credits.

### RAWG Api 

We used the RAWG Api Key for our project functionality to store required data neccesary for displaying game suggestions along with theyre respective links to where you can purchase the game yourself.

Link to RAWG Api site: https://rawg.io/  



## Tech Stack

we used a combination of standard html/css aswell as Bootstrap for our projects front page search bar and *Makers Gaming Reccomendation cards.

Also included is our javaScript code to implement our Api into our site on the backend.
